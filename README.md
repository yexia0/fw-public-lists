# Firewalla Public Lists

A community-maintained collection of optional blocklists and other curated datasets for [Firewalla](https://firewalla.com/) devices. This repo exists to provide:
- **Optional** lists for users who want extra filtering or categorization
- **Transparency** around what's included
- **Community contributions** to keep lists accurate and up-to-date
- **A central place** for Firewalla users to share curated, useful datasets

> [!Important]
> These lists are community-curated and may not be 100% complete or accurate. 
> Use at your own discretion. Firewalla does not guarantee the behavior of third-party domains, nor does it mandate the use of these lists.

These lists are **not required** for Firewalla operation. They are strictly optional tools for users who want them.
